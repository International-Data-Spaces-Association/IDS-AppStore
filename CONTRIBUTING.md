# Contributing to the IDS AppStore

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the IDS AppStore. This is an ongoing
project of the [Fraunhofer FIT](https://www.fit.fraunhofer.de/en.html) hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/IDS-AppStore). You are very
welcome to contribute to this project when you find a bug, want to suggest an improvement, or have
an idea for a useful feature. For this, always create an issue, a corresponding branch, and open a
pull request, and follow our style guides as described below.

Please note that we have a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that all developers should stick to.

## Changelog

We document changes in the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) on root level which is formatted and
maintained according to the rules documented on http://keepachangelog.com.

## Issues

You always have to create an issue if you want to integrate a bugfix, improvement, or feature.
Briefly and clearly describe the purpose of your contribution in the corresponding issue.
The pre-defined labels improve the understanding of your intentions and help to follow
the scope of your changes.

**Bug Report**: As mentioned above, bug reports should be submitted as an issue. To give others
the chance to reproduce the error in order to find a solution as quickly as possible, the report
should at least include the following information:
* Description: What did you expect and what happened instead?
* Steps to reproduce (system specs included)
* Relevant logs and/or media (optional): e.g. an image

## Branches

After creating an issue yourself or if you want to address an existing issue, you have to create a
branch with a unique number and name that assigns it to an issue. Therefore, follow the guidelines
at https://deepsource.io/blog/git-branch-naming-conventions/. After your changes, update the
`README.md`, Wiki, and `CHANGELOG.md` with necessary details. Then, create a pull request and note
that **committing to the main branch is not allowed**. Please use the feature `linked issues` to
link issues and pull requests.

## Commits

We encourage all contributors to stick to the commit convention following the specification on
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). In general, use  the
imperative in the present tense. A quick overview of the schema:
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
[optional body]
[optional footer(s)]
```

Types: `fix`, `feat`, `chore`, `test`, `refactor`, `docs`, `release`. Append `!` for breaking
changes to a type.

An example of a very good commit might look like this: `feat![login]: add awesome breaking feature`

## Versioning
This project uses the [SemVer](https://semver.org/) for versioning. The release versions are tagged
with their respective version.
