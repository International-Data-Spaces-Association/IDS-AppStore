The International Data Spaces App Store is a secure platform for the distribution of data apps. 

[Data apps](./data-app) can be used to process or transform data before or after the actual data exchange. Data apps are applications that can be deployed inside the [Connector](https://international-data-spaces-association.github.io/DataspaceConnector/), the core technical component required for a participant to join the International Data Spaces. Data apps facilitate data processing workflows. To be accessed and used, each data app plus corresponding metadata information must be published in the App Store. The App Store is responsible for managing information about data apps. Therefore, the App Store should provide interfaces for publishing and retrieving data apps and their corresponding metadata.

For each data app that was successfully certified, the corresponding metadata is stored in the App Store. Via a search interface, suitable data apps for one's own use can be identfied. The IDS App Store offers various search options (e.g., by functional or non-functional properties, pricing model, certification status, community ratings, etc.). Suitable data apps can be requested.

An IDS App Store further supports the registration of available data apps. Therefore, an App Store supports operations for registering, publishing, maintaining, and querying data apps, as well as operations for making a data app available to a connector. These basic operations can be complemented by additional services such as billing or support services.
